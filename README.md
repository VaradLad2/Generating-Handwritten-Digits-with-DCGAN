# **Generating Handwritten Digits with DCGAN**  
This project demonstrates the use of a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** to generate realistic handwritten digits trained on the **MNIST dataset**. It provides an end-to-end implementation, from loading the dataset to training and visualizing the generated results.

## **Abstract**  
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks that generate new data similar to a given dataset. This project implements a DCGAN, which uses convolutional layers to generate high-quality images of handwritten digits. The generator creates fake handwritten digits, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. Through iterative training, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic outputs.  

This project is built for beginners exploring GANs and leverages the MNIST dataset to create a practical example of generative modeling.

## **How It Works**
1. **Dataset**:  
   The **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits (0â€“9) is used. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels in grayscale.  

2. **Generator**:  
   - Takes random noise as input and generates fake images resembling handwritten digits.  
   - Built with transposed convolutional layers to upsample noise into image dimensions.  

3. **Discriminator**:  
   - Differentiates between real MNIST images and fake images produced by the generator.  
   - Built with convolutional layers to classify input images as real or fake.  

4. **Training**:  
   - Both models are trained simultaneously in an adversarial setup.  
   - The generator aims to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to correctly identify fake images.  
   - Loss functions and optimizers are applied to improve both models iteratively.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - During training, generated images are saved after every epoch to monitor progress.  
   - The generator produces high-quality digits after sufficient training.

## **Features**  
- Generates handwritten digits from random noise.  
- Interactive visualizations for monitoring training progress.  
- Supports training in Google Colab with GPU acceleration.  
- Fully customizable architecture for both generator and discriminator.
