# Generating-Handwritten-Digits-with-DCGAN
Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for generating handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Features preprocessing, generator/discriminator models, training scripts, and visualization of generated images. Trains on Google Colab with TensorFlow. Ideal for learning GANs and creating realistic handwritten-style digits from random noise.
